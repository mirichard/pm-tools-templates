## 🌿 Branching Strategy

### Branch Creation
- Create branches from `development`
- Use naming convention: `feat/<ticket-id>-slug`, `fix/<ticket-id>-slug`, or `chore/<task>`

### Workflow
1. Push immediately and open a Draft PR to `development`
2. Ensure CI passes
3. Squash-merge; branch auto-deletes
4. Nightly job promotes `development` → `staging` → `main`

### Step 2: Create Your Content

1. **Follow Naming Conventions**

   - Be descriptive but concise: `stakeholder-communication-plan`
   - Include template type: `project-charter-template`

2. **Test Your Template**
   - Use it in a real or simulated project scenario

   - Ensure all links and references work

3. **Document Everything**

   - Provide context for when to use the template
   - Add customization guidance
   - Include a filled example (with sensitive data removed)
