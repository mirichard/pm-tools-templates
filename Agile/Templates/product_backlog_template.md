## 1. Backlog Structure and Organization

### 1.1 Backlog Hierarchy
The Product Backlog is organized using a hierarchical structure to manage complexity and provide appropriate levels of detail:

**Epics**
- Large bodies of work that can be broken down into smaller components
- Typically span multiple sprints or releases
- Provide a high-level view of major features or capabilities

**Features**
- Specific functionality that delivers value to users
- Typically broken down from epics
- May span one or more sprints

**User Stories**
- Small, independent, valuable pieces of functionality
- Typically completable within a single sprint
- Written from user perspective

**Tasks**
- Technical activities required to complete a user story
- Typically assigned to individual team members
- Usually completed within a few days

### 1.2 Backlog Sections
The Product Backlog is organized into the following sections:

**Current Release**  
Items planned for the upcoming release, with high level of detail and refinement.

**Future Releases**  
Items planned for future releases, with less detail and refinement.

**Technical Debt**  
Non-functional improvements, refactoring, and other technical items needed to maintain product quality.

**Research Spikes**  
Investigations needed to understand complex problems before creating detailed user stories.

## 2. User Story Format

### 2.1 User Story Template
User stories follow this format:

```
As a [type of user],
I want [an action or feature]
So that [benefit/value]
```

### 2.2 Acceptance Criteria
Each user story includes clear acceptance criteria that define when the story is complete. Acceptance criteria follow the Given-When-Then format:

```
Given [precondition]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
```

### 2.3 Additional Story Attributes

**Epic Link**  
The epic to which this story belongs

**Business Value**  
Numeric indicator (1-10) of value to the business

**Dependencies**  
Other stories that must be completed before this one

**Attachments**  
Mockups, diagrams, or other supporting documents

**Notes**  
Additional context or information

### 2.4 User Story Example

```
ID: US-123
Title: User Login

As a registered user,
I want to log in to my account using my email and password
So that I can access my personal dashboard and settings

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Given I am on the login page
   When I enter a valid email and password
   Then I should be successfully logged in and redirected to my dashboard

2. Given I am on the login page
   When I enter an invalid email or password
   Then I should see an appropriate error message

3. Given I am on the login page
   When I click the "Forgot Password" link
   Then I should be directed to the password reset page

4. Given I am logged in
   When I click the logout button
   Then I should be logged out and redirected to the login page

Epic Link: User Authentication
Business Value: 8
Story Points: 5
Dependencies: US-100 (User Registration)
Attachments: login_screen_mockup.png
Notes: Implement using OAuth 2.0 protocol
```

## 3. Estimation Guidelines

### 3.1 Story Point Scale
This product backlog uses the Fibonacci sequence for story point estimation:

| Points | Complexity | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Trivial | Text change, simple UI update |
| 2 | Simple | Basic form with minimal validation |
| 3 | Small | Feature with simple business logic |
| 5 | Medium | Feature with moderate complexity |
| 8 | Large | Complex feature with multiple components |
| 13 | Very Large | Feature with significant complexity and dependencies |
| 21 | Extra Large | Should be broken down into smaller stories |

### 3.2 Relative Sizing
Story points represent relative effort, not absolute time. Consider these factors when estimating:
- Complexity
- Uncertainty/Risk
- Effort required
- Volume of work

### 3.3 Estimation Process
1. **Planning Poker**: Team members estimate stories simultaneously to avoid anchoring bias
2. **Reference Stories**: Compare new stories to previously estimated ones
3. **Team Consensus**: Discuss differences in estimates to reach agreement
4. **Continuous Calibration**: Regularly review and adjust estimation accuracy

### 3.4 Velocity Calculation
Team velocity is calculated as the average number of story points completed over the last 3 sprints. Current team velocity: [XX] points per sprint.

## 4. Prioritization Framework

### 4.1 Prioritization Factors
Items in the Product Backlog are prioritized based on these factors:

**Business Value**  
How much value does this item deliver to customers or the business?

**Cost of Delay**  
What is the impact of not implementing this item now?

**Risk/Opportunity**  
Does this item mitigate significant risks or unlock key opportunities?

**Dependencies**  
Does this item unblock other high-value work?

**Effort/Complexity**  
How complex or time-consuming is the implementation?

### 4.2 Priority Levels
The Product Backlog uses these priority levels:

| Priority | Description | Timeframe |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Critical | Must have for the current release | Current sprint or next sprint |
| High | Important for current release | Within next 2-3 sprints |
| Medium | Desired for current release but could be deferred | Current release |
| Low | Nice to have, can be deferred to future releases | Future release |

### 4.3 WSJF Scoring (Optional)
For complex prioritization decisions, Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) may be used:

WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Size

Where Cost of Delay combines:
- Business value
- Time criticality
- Risk reduction/opportunity enablement

### 4.4 MoSCoW Method (Optional)
For release planning, items may be categorized using the MoSCoW method:
- **Must Have**: Required for the release to be successful
- **Should Have**: Important but not necessary for initial release
- **Could Have**: Desirable if time and resources permit
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for this release but may be considered later

## 5. Backlog Refinement Process

### 5.1 Refinement Cadence
Backlog refinement is an ongoing process with dedicated sessions held:
- Formal refinement meeting: Weekly, [Day] at [Time]
- Duration: 1-2 hours
- Participants: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team

### 5.2 Refinement Activities
1. **Review and Update**: Examine existing backlog items
2. **Breaking Down**: Split larger items into smaller, sprint-sized stories
3. **Adding Detail**: Clarify requirements and acceptance criteria
4. **Estimating**: Size new or updated items
5. **Prioritizing**: Review and adjust item priorities
6. **Identifying Dependencies**: Flag and address dependencies between items

### 5.3 Preparation for Refinement
**Product Owner**:
- Pre-identify items for discussion
- Prepare initial detail for new items
- Consider business priorities

**Development Team**:
- Review items before the meeting
- Note questions and concerns
- Consider technical implications

**Scrum Master**:
- Facilitate the process
- Keep focus on highest priority items
- Time-box discussions

### 5.4 Ready for Sprint Planning
The top items in the Product Backlog should be refined to be "Ready" for Sprint Planning. The goal is to have at least 2 sprints' worth of "Ready" stories at all times.
