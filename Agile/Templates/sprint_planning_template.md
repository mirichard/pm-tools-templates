## 1. Sprint Planning Meeting Structure

### 1.1 Meeting Logistics
- **Date and Time:** *[YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM - HH:MM]*
- **Location:** *[Meeting Room / Virtual Platform]*
- **Participants:** *[List team members present]*
- **Duration:** *[Maximum of 8 hours for a 4-week sprint, proportionally less for shorter sprints]*

### 1.2 Two-Part Structure

#### Part 1: "WHAT" (1st half)
Led by the Product Owner, this part focuses on selecting Product Backlog Items (PBIs) for the Sprint:

1. **Review Product Backlog**: Product Owner presents the highest priority items
2. **Discuss and Clarify**: Development Team asks questions to understand requirements
3. **Define Sprint Goal**: Collaborative formulation of a clear, focused goal
4. **Select PBIs**: Team selects items that align with the goal and can be completed within the Sprint
5. **Confirm Scope**: Team and Product Owner reach agreement on the selected items

#### Part 2: "HOW" (2nd half)
Led by the Development Team, this part focuses on how the work will be accomplished:

1. **Task Breakdown**: Team breaks down PBIs into tasks
2. **Effort Estimation**: Team estimates effort for each task
3. **Capacity Check**: Compare effort to available capacity
4. **Dependency Identification**: Identify dependencies and sequencing
5. **Volunteer for Tasks**: Team members self-select initial tasks
6. **Finalize Commitment**: Team confirms commitment to deliver the Sprint Backlog

### 1.3 Meeting Facilitation Tips (For Scrum Master)

- Keep the meeting timeboxed and focused
- Ensure all team members participate
- Address impediments that arise during planning
- Capture action items and decisions
- Help the team make realistic commitments
- Prevent detailed design discussions (defer to later sessions)
- Keep the focus on the Sprint Goal
- Use visual tools to maintain engagement

---

## 2. Sprint Goal

### 2.1 Sprint Goal Definition
*A concise statement that provides focus and direction for the Sprint. It should be specific, measurable, and achievable within the Sprint timebox.*

### 2.2 Characteristics of Good Sprint Goals

- **Focused**: Addresses a specific business need or value
- **Concise**: Can be easily remembered and communicated
- **Inspirational**: Motivates the team
- **Independent**: Not contingent on work outside the Sprint
- **Measurable**: Success can be objectively determined
- **Achievable**: Realistic within the Sprint timebox

### 2.3 Sprint Goal Creation Process

1. Product Owner proposes initial goal based on business priorities
2. Team discusses and refines the goal
3. Team confirms the goal is achievable within the Sprint
4. Team and Product Owner agree on final wording

### 2.4 Sprint Goal Example

*Example: "Deliver a fully functional user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, reset passwords, and manage their profiles, enabling secure access to the customer portal."*

## 3. Capacity Planning

### 3.1 Team Capacity Calculation

| Team Member | Role | Days Available | Hours/Day | Total Hours | Notes |
|-------------|------|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| *Alex Smith* | *Frontend Developer* | *8* | *6* | *48* | *PTO on [dates]* |
| *Jamie Jones* | *Backend Developer* | *10* | *6* | *60* | *Full availability* |
| *Riley Green* | *QA Engineer* | *7* | *6* | *42* | *Training on [dates]* |
| *Casey Brown* | *UX Designer* | *5* | *4* | *20* | *Shared resource (50%)* |
| **TOTAL** | | | | **170** | |

### 3.2 Capacity Adjustments

- **Standard Availability**: Full sprint is [10] working days
- **Focus Factor**: [80%] (accounts for meetings, emails, interruptions)
- **Adjusted Team Capacity**: [170] hours Ã— [80%] = [136] hours

### 3.3 Historical Velocity

| Sprint | Story Points Completed |
|--------|------------------------|
| Sprint 1 | 24 |
| Sprint 2 | 28 |
| Sprint 3 | 22 |
| Sprint 4 | 26 |
| **Average** | **25** |

### 3.4 Sprint Capacity Planning Notes

*Example: Based on our average velocity of 25 story points and our adjusted capacity of 136 hours, we're planning to commit to 26 story points for Sprint 5. This is slightly above our average velocity but the team feels confident due to reduced dependencies and improved knowledge of the codebase.*
