# Sprint Retrospective Template

## Overview
This template provides a structured approach to conducting effective Sprint Retrospectives, helping teams to continuously improve their processes, collaboration, and overall performance. Sprint Retrospectives are a critical part of the Scrum framework, providing teams with a dedicated time to reflect on their work, identify what went well, what didn't, and create action plans for improvement.

## Meeting Information

**Sprint:** [Sprint Number or Name]  
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Time:** [HH:MM] - [HH:MM]  
**Location:** [Physical location or virtual meeting link]  
**Facilitator:** [Name of the Scrum Master or designated facilitator]  
**Participants:** [List of team members present]  
**Absent:** [List of team members absent]  

## Retrospective Pre-Work

Before the session begins, consider:

- Reviewing Sprint metrics (velocity, burn-down/up charts, escaped defects, etc.)
- Gathering feedback from stakeholders
- Reviewing previous retrospective action items
- Preparing retrospective format materials
- Setting up collaborative tools (physical or digital)
- Ensuring a comfortable environment for open discussion

## Safety Check

Before diving into retrospective discussions, assess the team's psychological safety level to ensure members feel comfortable sharing their honest thoughts.

### Safety Check Exercise

Ask team members to anonymously rate from 1-5:

1. **I'm afraid to share my opinions openly**
2. **I'm comfortable sharing some thoughts but hold back on sensitive topics**
3. **I'll share my thoughts if asked directly**
4. **I'm comfortable sharing most of my thoughts openly**
5. **I share everything on my mind without fear of consequences**

*Facilitator note: If the average is below 3, consider addressing safety issues before proceeding with the full retrospective.*

### Establishing Ground Rules

- **Be respectful**: Focus on behaviors and outcomes, not people
- **Stay solution-oriented**: Critique is valuable when paired with suggestions
- **Equal voice**: Everyone gets time to speak
- **No blame**: We're here to learn, not assign blame
- **Confidentiality**: What's discussed stays within the team
- **Assume positive intent**: We're all working toward improvement

## Previous Action Items Review

Review action items from the previous retrospective:

| [Description] | [Name] | [Complete/In Progress/Not Started] | [Comments on progress, roadblocks, or outcomes] |

### Effectiveness Assessment

## Facilitation Guide

### Preparation Checklist

- [ ] Book appropriate meeting space or virtual room
- [ ] Send calendar invites with clear agenda
- [ ] Prepare materials for chosen retrospective format
- [ ] Review previous retrospective outcomes
- [ ] Ensure tools are working (boards, sticky notes, digital tools)
- [ ] Print or share this template before the meeting

### Time Management

A typical 1-hour retrospective breakdown:
- **5 minutes**: Welcome and ground rules
- **5 minutes**: Safety check
- **10 minutes**: Previous action items review
- **20 minutes**: Main retrospective format
- **10 minutes**: Action item identification and assignment
- **5 minutes**: Team health check
- **5 minutes**: Wrap-up and appreciations

### Facilitation Tips

- Ask open-ended questions
- Use "why" sparingly; prefer "what" and "how" questions
- Ensure balanced participation across the team
- Redirect blame conversations to problem-solving
- Capture action items in real-time
- Consider using a parking lot for off-topic issues
- Rotate facilitation duties to build team ownership
- Keep retrospectives regular, regardless of sprint outcomes

### Remote Retrospective Considerations

- Use collaborative tools (Miro, Mural, Retrium, etc.)
- Have a clear "talking order" to prevent people talking over each other
- Use video when possible to capture non-verbal cues
- Consider async pre-work to maximize synchronous time
- Build in extra time for technology issues
- Use polls and breakout rooms for larger teams

## Example Activities and Exercises

### Lean Coffee

1. Team members write discussion topics on sticky notes
2. Team dots-votes on which topics to discuss
3. Sort topics by vote count
4. Time-box discussion for each topic (e.g., 5 minutes)
5. At time limit, vote whether to continue for 3 more minutes or move on

### Three Little Pigs

Team classifies aspects of the sprint as:
- **Brick House**: Solid, sturdy practices we want to keep
- **Stick House**: Practices that need reinforcement
- **Straw House**: Weak practices that might collapse under pressure

### Speed Boat

Draw a speedboat with:
- **Engine**: What propels us forward?
- **Anchor**: What slows us down?
- **Wind**: What external forces help us?
- **Rocks**: What risks lie ahead?

### Constellation

1. Define dimensions to evaluate (communication, quality, etc.)
2. Create a spectrum for each dimension (e.g., "poor" to "excellent")
3. Team members physically position themselves along each spectrum
4. Discuss the positions and why people placed themselves there
5. Identify improvements based on positions

### Empathy Mapping

For understanding stakeholder or customer perspective:
- **Says**: What did they express verbally?
- **Thinks**: What are their unspoken thoughts?
- **Does**: What actions did they take?
- **Feels**: What emotions might they experience?
