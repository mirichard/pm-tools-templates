# Hybrid Release Planning Template

## Overview
This template provides a framework for planning and managing releases in hybrid project environments that combine traditional (predictive) and agile (adaptive) approaches. It enables teams to coordinate delivery across different methodologies while maintaining a coherent release strategy. Adapt sections as needed based on your specific project context, methodology balance, and organizational requirements.

## Release Strategy and Planning Approach

### Release Vision and Goals
Describe the high-level vision and business goals for your releases.

*Example:*
> Our release strategy aims to deliver customer-facing features incrementally while aligning with quarterly business reviews and annual compliance requirements. Each release will provide measurable business value through at least one complete customer journey improvement.

### Release Cadence and Structure
Define the release frequency and structure.

| Release Type | Frequency | Scope Type | Primary Driver |
|--------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Major Release | Quarterly | Mixed | Business planning cycles |
| Feature Release | Monthly | Primarily Adaptive | Customer value |
| Patch Release | As needed | Fixed | Critical fixes |
| Compliance Release | Annually | Fixed | Regulatory requirements |

### Hybrid Planning Approach
Describe how different planning methodologies will be combined.

*Example:*
> Our hybrid release planning uses:
> - Annual planning for infrastructure and compliance components (traditional)
> - Quarterly planning for major features and integration points (hybrid)
> - 2-week sprint planning for user-facing features (agile)
>
> These planning horizons are synchronized through bi-weekly cross-team coordination meetings and formal quarterly release planning sessions.

### Planning Horizons Matrix

| Horizon | Timeframe | Confidence Level | Plan Detail | Update Frequency |
|---------|-----------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Strategic | 6-12 months | Low | Themes & epics | Quarterly |
| Release | 3 months | Medium | Features | Monthly |
| Iteration | 2 weeks | High | User stories & tasks | Weekly |

### Dependency Resolution Process
Describe the process for identifying, tracking, and resolving dependencies.

1. **Identify**: During planning sessions, teams identify potential dependencies
2. **Document**: Dependencies are logged in the dependency register
3. **Analyze**: Impact and criticality are assessed
4. **Coordinate**: Dependencies are communicated to affected teams
5. **Track**: Regular dependency review meetings are held
6. **Resolve**: Resolution plans are developed for critical dependencies

### Dependency Visualization Example

```
[Authentication Service] ---> [User Profile Feature]
         |                           |

| [Feature 1] | [Value Stream] | [Contribution] | [Traditional/Agile] | [H/M/L] |
| [Feature 2] | [Value Stream] | [Contribution] | [Traditional/Agile] | [H/M/L] |
| [Feature 3] | [Value Stream] | [Contribution] | [Traditional/Agile] | [H/M/L] |

### Value Stream Flow Analysis Example

*Example for a Customer Onboarding Value Stream:*

```
[Application] → [Verification] → [Account Setup] → [Welcome Package] → [First Transaction]
   (Agile)       (Traditional)      (Agile)        (Traditional)        (Agile)
 
Lead Time: 3 days   7 days         1 day           5 days             2 days
```

## Scope Management Across Methodologies

### Scope Definition Approaches

| Component | Scope Definition Method | Change Process | Tracking Method |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| [Fixed Component] | [Detailed requirements] | [Formal change control] | [Requirements traceability] |
| [Flexible Component] | [User stories and backlog] | [Backlog refinement] | [Story points and velocity] |
| [Hybrid Component] | [Mixed approach] | [Tiered change control] | [Combined metrics] |

### Scope Change Process
Describe how scope changes are managed across different methodologies.

*Example:*
> Scope changes are managed through a tiered approach:
> - Level 1: Team-level changes that don't affect release commitments can be approved by Product Owners
> - Level 2: Changes that affect release scope but not milestones require Product Manager approval
> - Level 3: Changes that affect milestones or release dates require Change Control Board approval

### Scope Prioritization Framework
Define how scope is prioritized across traditional and agile components.

| Priority Level | Description | Change Authority | Examples |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Critical | Required for release, no compromise | Executive Sponsor | Security, compliance features |
| High | Important business value, little flexibility | Product Committee | Core user journeys |
| Medium | Valuable but adaptable | Product Owner | Enhancement features |
| Low | Nice to have, can be deferred | Development Team | Visual refinements |

## Template Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Template

This template is most appropriate for:

- Projects that combine traditional and agile delivery methods
- Products with mixed component types (e.g., backend services, user interfaces)
- Organizations transitioning from waterfall to agile methodologies
- Complex releases requiring coordination across multiple teams
- Products with both fixed and variable scope elements

### How to Complete This Template

1. **Start with release strategy**: Define your overall approach before detailing specific plans
2. **Workshop key sections**: Involve both traditional and agile teams in planning sessions
3. **Right-size for your project**: Expand or condense sections based on your project's complexity
4. **Customize methodologies by component**: Apply different approaches to different components
5. **Keep it living**: Update regularly as you learn and as circumstances change

### Best Practices

1. **Focus on integration points**: Pay special attention to where traditional and agile work streams intersect
2. **Use visual management**: Maintain visible roadmaps and dependency maps for all teams
3. **Synchronize cadences**: Create a rhythm where agile iterations align with traditional milestones
4. **Speak both languages**: Translate between traditional and agile terminology in communications
5. **Emphasize value delivery**: Keep focus on business outcomes rather than methodology purity
6. **Maintain flexibility**: Build buffers and contingency for adaptability
7. **Cross-train teams**: Help team members understand both methodologies

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Methodology wars**: Avoid debates about which approach is "better"
- **Over-planning**: Don't try to plan everything in detail upfront
- **Silos**: Don't let traditional and agile teams become isolated from each other
- **Rigid governance**: Don't apply the same governance to all components
- **Ignoring dependencies**: Dependencies between methodologies need special attention
- **Communication gaps**: Different teams may use different terminology
