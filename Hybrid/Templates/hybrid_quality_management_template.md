*Example:*
> Our quality strategy balances rigorous validation of critical system components with rapid feedback cycles, ensuring we meet compliance requirements while delivering value continuously. We value both process adherence where necessary and built-in quality through automated testing, with the goal of creating a product that meets stakeholder needs, compliance requirements, and user expectations.

### Quality Objectives

## Quality Assurance Approaches

### Quality Assurance Strategy

Describe the overall approach to quality assurance that balances traditional and agile practices:

High-risk or regulated components follow more traditional QA with detailed documentation and formal reviews, while other components utilize agile quality practices such as automated testing and continuous integration. All components, regardless of methodology, must meet defined quality gates before release.

### Component Classification for QA Approach

Classify components to determine appropriate QA approach:

| Classification | Characteristics | QA Approach | Example Components |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **High Criticality** | High risk, regulatory impact, core functionality | Formal QA with comprehensive documentation | Payment processing, security features, compliance modules |
| **Medium Criticality** | Moderate risk, business-critical, significant impact | Balanced QA with key documentation and automation | Customer data management, reporting, primary user workflows |

#### Quality Retrospectives

Conduct regular hybrid quality retrospectives to improve quality practices:

**Frequency**: [Monthly/Quarterly]

**Participants**: Representatives from all teams and quality roles

**Agenda**:
1. Review quality metrics and trends
2. Analyze quality successes and challenges
3. Identify improvement opportunities
4. Prioritize actions
5. Assign responsibility for improvements

**Focus Questions**:
- What quality practices are working well across methodologies?
- Where are we experiencing quality challenges or friction?
- How effective are our integration points between traditional and agile quality?
- What can we learn from other teams or organizations?
- What one quality improvement would make the biggest difference?

#### Knowledge Management and Learning

Establish mechanisms for quality knowledge sharing:

1. **Quality Community of Practice**
   - Regular meetings to share practices and challenges
   - Cross-team and cross-methodology representation
   - External speakers and best practice sharing

2. **Quality Knowledge Base**
   - Central repository for quality guidelines, templates, and examples
   - Lessons learned from quality issues and successes
   - Methodology-specific and hybrid approach documentation

3. **Mentoring and Training**
   - Cross-methodology mentoring partnerships
   - Targeted training for quality skill development
   - Certification paths for quality specialists

## Template Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Template

This template is most appropriate for:

- Projects combining traditional and agile development methodologies
- Organizations transitioning from traditional to agile approaches
- Programs with diverse teams using different methodologies
- Environments with significant compliance or regulatory requirements
- Complex projects requiring flexible quality approaches

### How to Customize This Template

1. **Assessment First**: Begin by assessing your current quality practices and needs
2. **Prioritize Sections**: Focus on the areas that represent your greatest quality challenges
3. **Right-Size Content**: Adapt the detail level to match your project complexity and team maturity
4. **Workshop Key Elements**: Collaboratively develop critical components with all stakeholders
5. **Incremental Implementation**: Don't try to implement everything at once; phase in changes

### Implementation Steps

1. **Quality Strategy Development**
   - Define your hybrid quality vision and objectives
   - Identify critical quality requirements
   - Determine component classification approach

2. **Quality Planning**
   - Document quality standards and criteria
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Select appropriate tools and techniques

3. **Quality Implementation**
   - Establish review and testing processes
   - Implement quality metrics and measurements
   - Define quality gates and checkpoints

4. **Quality Improvement**
   - Collect and analyze quality data
   - Identify improvement opportunities
   - Implement continuous improvement cycle

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-standardization**: Forcing one approach across all components
- **Under-governance**: Insufficient quality oversight for critical components
- **Tool fragmentation**: Too many disconnected quality tools
- **Methodology wars**: Creating tension between traditional and agile practitioners
- **Metrics overload**: Tracking too many metrics without clear purpose
- **Documentation extremes**: Either too much or too little documentation
