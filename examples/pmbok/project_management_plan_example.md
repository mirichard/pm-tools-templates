---

## 3. Schedule Management

### 3.1 Schedule Management Approach
The project schedule will be developed using Microsoft Project based on the WBS and activity sequencing. The critical path will be identified and closely monitored. The schedule will be updated weekly and reviewed in status meetings. Schedule variances exceeding 10% will trigger corrective actions. The schedule will use a phased approach to migration to minimize risks and disruptions to business operations.

### 3.2 Schedule Development Methodology
Activity definition was based on the WBS, with input from subject matter experts and historical data from similar data center migration projects. Duration estimates were created using three-point estimating (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic) and validated by the project team. Dependencies were identified through planning sessions with key stakeholders and technical experts. Resource availability was considered when developing the schedule.

### 3.3 Schedule Control
Schedule performance will be measured using Earned Value Management metrics (SPI, SV). The critical path will be analyzed weekly to identify potential delays. Schedule changes will be evaluated through the change control process and may require re-baselining with appropriate approvals. Buffer time has been included for high-risk activities, particularly during migration weekends. A rolling wave planning approach will be used to elaborate the schedule in greater detail as the project progresses.

## 8. Risk Management

### 8.1 Risk Management Approach
The project will follow a proactive risk management approach to identify, assess, and mitigate risks throughout the project lifecycle. Risks will be identified through regular risk identification workshops, team input, and lessons learned from similar migration projects. Risks will be assessed based on probability and impact, and appropriate response strategies will be developed. Special attention will be given to risks related to data loss, extended downtime, and performance issues, which are common in data center migrations.

### 8.2 Risk Identification
Risk identification will be performed through:
1. Initial risk identification workshop during project planning
2. Regular risk review sessions during project status meetings
3. Technical reviews and quality gates
4. Vendor risk assessments
5. Application dependency mapping and technical assessments
6. Migration readiness assessments
7. Security and compliance assessments
8. Team member input channels
9. Lessons learned from similar data center migration projects

### 8.3 Risk Analysis
Risks will be analyzed using a qualitative approach based on probability and impact. Each risk will be rated on a scale of 1-5 for both probability and impact, resulting in a risk score from 1-25. Risks with scores of 15-25 are considered high, 8-14 medium, and 1-7 low. High and medium risks will have detailed response plans developed and actively monitored. Quantitative analysis will be performed for high-impact risks affecting budget or schedule, including potential downtime costs.

Risk categorization will include:
- Technical Risks: Related to technology compatibility, performance, and integration
- Migration Risks: Related to the migration process and data transfer
- Operational Risks: Related to ongoing operations and support
- Schedule Risks: Related to timeline and milestones
- Resource Risks: Related to resource availability and skills
- Vendor Risks: Related to external providers and services
- Compliance Risks: Related to regulatory and policy compliance
- Security Risks: Related to data protection and system security

### 8.4 Risk Response Planning
Response strategies will be developed for all medium and high risks and will include one or more of the following approaches:
1. Avoid: Eliminate the threat by eliminating the cause
2. Transfer: Shift the impact of the threat to a third party
3. Mitigate: Reduce the probability or impact of the threat
4. Accept: Acknowledge the risk and take no action unless the risk occurs

For critical migration risks, contingency plans will be developed including rollback procedures for major migrations. Risk response owners will be assigned for each risk to ensure accountability for monitoring and implementing response strategies.

### 8.5 Risk Monitoring and Control
Risks will be documented in the Risk Register and reviewed weekly during project status meetings. Risk owners will be assigned to monitor and manage specific risks. Risk status updates will be required from risk owners before each status meeting. Risk triggers will be identified and monitored. The Risk Register will be updated as new risks are identified or existing risks change in probability, impact, or status.

High-risk migration activities will have dedicated risk monitoring protocols, including real-time monitoring during migration weekends and daily reviews during critical migration phases.

Critical vendor deliverables will be subject to additional oversight, including inspection and testing by specialized team members. For the co-location facility, site visits and audits will be conducted to verify compliance with contractual requirements for power, cooling, security, and connectivity.

### 9.6 Vendor Transition Planning
As part of the data center migration, several existing vendor contracts will need to be modified or terminated. A vendor transition plan will be developed that includes:

1. Inventory of existing vendor contracts affected by the migration
2. Analysis of termination conditions and costs
3. Identification of required contract modifications
4. Timeline for vendor transitions aligned with migration schedule
5. Communication plan for vendor transitions
6. Assignment of responsibilities for vendor transition management

## 11. Change Management

### 11.1 Change Management Approach
The project will implement a formal change management process to ensure that changes to project scope, schedule, budget, and deliverables are properly identified, evaluated, approved, and implemented. All project stakeholders will be informed about the change management process, and adherence to the process will be required.

For this data center migration project, a hierarchy of change types will be established to ensure appropriate oversight without causing delays:
- Level 1 (Minor): Technical adjustments within approved scope (Technical Lead approval)
- Level 2 (Moderate): Changes affecting schedule or resources within thresholds (Project Manager approval)
- Level 3 (Significant): Changes affecting scope, budget, or critical path (Change Control Board approval)
- Level 4 (Major): Changes affecting project objectives or baselined constraints (Steering Committee approval)

### 11.2 Change Control Process
The change control process includes the following steps:

1. **Submit Change Request**: Any stakeholder may submit a change request using the Change Request Form
2. **Log and Review**: The Project Manager logs the request and performs initial review for completeness
3. **Impact Assessment**: The project team assesses the impact on scope, schedule, budget, quality, and risks
4. **Evaluation and Recommendation**: The Project Manager evaluates the impacts and makes a recommendation
5. **Decision**: The appropriate authority reviews the change request and makes a decision (approve/reject/defer)
6. **Implementation**: Approved changes are implemented, with project plans updated accordingly
7. **Communication**: Stakeholders are notified about the decision and impacts
8. **Closure**: The change request is updated with the outcome and closed

For migration-related changes that arise during execution, an expedited process will be defined to ensure rapid response during critical migration weekends.

### 11.3 Change Control Authority
The following authority levels are established for approving changes:

- **Project Manager**: May approve Level 1 and 2 changes that do not impact the critical path, and changes within the contingency budget up to $25,000
- **Change Control Board**: Must approve Level 3 changes that impact baseline scope, schedule, or budget
- **Project Sponsor**: Must approve changes with significant impact (>5% of budget or >2 weeks of schedule)
- **Steering Committee**: Must approve Level 4 changes with major impact (>10% of budget or >4 weeks of schedule)

During migration weekends, the Technical Lead will have temporary approval authority for emergency technical changes that do not impact overall timeline or scope.

### 11.4 Change Control Board
The Change Control Board (CCB) consists of:
- Project Sponsor (Chair): Sarah Johnson, CIO
- Project Manager: Michael Chen, PMP
- Technical Lead: James Wilson, Enterprise Architect
- IT Infrastructure Director: David Williams
- Finance Representative: Mark Thompson (or delegate)
- Security Representative: Thomas Anderson

The CCB meets bi-weekly or as needed. Emergency meetings can be called for urgent changes. Decisions require a majority vote, with the Sponsor having a deciding vote in case of a tie.

### 11.5 Change Control Tools and Documentation
The following tools and documentation will be used in the change control process:

- **Change Request Form**: Used to submit and document change requests
- **Change Log**: Tracks all change requests and their status
- **Change Impact Assessment Template**: Documents the analysis of change impacts
- **CCB Meeting Minutes**: Records CCB discussions and decisions
- **Project Plan Updates**: Documents how approved changes are incorporated into project plans

All change documentation will be stored in the project repository and linked to affected deliverables and project documents.
