## Executive Summary
This project will migrate the company's primary data center from the current on-premises facility to a hybrid cloud environment combining co-location and cloud services. The migration addresses critical space limitations, aging infrastructure, and increasing operational costs of the existing data center while improving reliability, scalability, and disaster recovery capabilities. This initiative directly supports the organization's Digital Transformation Strategy and will establish the foundation for future IT infrastructure modernization efforts.

## 1. Project Definition

### 1.1 Purpose and Justification
The current data center is approaching end-of-life with equipment that is 80% depreciated, insufficient power and cooling capacity, and limited physical space for expansion. Business growth has increased compute requirements by 35% over the past 3 years, and the facility cannot accommodate projected needs. This project will address these challenges by implementing a modern hybrid infrastructure that provides greater resilience, performance, and cost-efficiency while supporting future growth.

### 1.2 Business Case
- Initial investment: $2.5M
- Projected annual savings: $750K (reduced power, cooling, maintenance)
- Expected ROI: 30% over 3 years
- Additional benefits:
  - 99.99% improved uptime (versus current 99.9%)
  - 40% reduction in disaster recovery time
  - 50% faster provisioning of new resources
  - Enhanced security compliance
  - 30% reduction in carbon footprint

### 1.3 Project Objectives
1. Migrate 100% of data center services to the new hybrid environment with zero data loss by December 15, 2025
2. Reduce infrastructure operational costs by 30% within 6 months of completion
3. Improve system availability from 99.9% to 99.99% by February 2026
4. Implement enhanced disaster recovery capabilities with 4-hour RTO (reduced from current 24 hours) by January 2026
5. Decommission the existing data center by January 31, 2026

### 1.4 Project Description
The project encompasses the planning, design, and implementation of a hybrid cloud environment, migrating approximately 200 servers (physical and virtual), 5 storage systems, and networking infrastructure from the existing data center. It includes establishing a co-location facility for critical systems that must remain on dedicated hardware, implementing cloud services for appropriate workloads, and setting up new connectivity, security controls, and management systems.

The project excludes application modernization/refactoring, end-user desktop systems, and business process changes, which will be addressed in separate projects.

## 5. Initial Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Response Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Application compatibility issues with new infrastructure | High | Medium | Conduct thorough assessment and testing of all applications before migration; prepare contingency plans for problematic applications |
| Data loss during migration | High | Low | Implement comprehensive backup strategy; validate data integrity after each migration phase; maintain parallel operations until validation complete |
| Extended downtime during cutover | High | Medium | Develop detailed cutover plans with rollback procedures; schedule migrations during off-hours; conduct rehearsals for critical systems |
| Insufficient internal skills for new technologies | Medium | High | Provide early training for key personnel; engage vendor professional services; establish knowledge transfer plan |
| Cost overruns due to unforeseen technical challenges | Medium | Medium | Include contingency reserve in budget; implement strict change control; conduct detailed planning and assessment phases |
| Vendor delays in co-location facility readiness | High | Low | Include penalties in contracts; develop contingency plans for schedule adjustments; maintain regular vendor management check-ins |
