### Schedule Metrics
* **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** 0.97 *(< 1.0 indicates behind schedule)*
* **Schedule Variance (SV):** -5 days
* **Critical Path Slack:** 10 days
* **Current Phase:** Co-location setup & Cloud provisioning
* **Phase Completion:** 70%

### Schedule Commentary
The project is currently 5 days behind schedule, primarily due to delays in the co-location facility setup. The co-location vendor experienced delays in receiving and installing the rack infrastructure. We've implemented a recovery plan that includes parallel work on network configuration and additional resources for expedited setup once equipment arrives. This should allow us to recover some of the lost time. The 10-day buffer in our critical path provides adequate protection against this delay impacting subsequent milestones. 

The cloud environment provisioning activities are proceeding on schedule, with 80% of the cloud architecture and provisioning work completed. Migration planning and runbook development for non-critical systems are on track, with the first test migrations scheduled to begin next week.

* **Cost Variance (CV):** $47,000
* **Percent Budget Spent:** 62.6%
* **Contingency Remaining:** $100,000 *(80% of original)*

### Budget Commentary
Overall, the project is currently tracking 2% under budget. We've realized savings in hardware procurement due to favorable vendor negotiations and reuse of more existing equipment than initially planned. These savings are offset by slight overages in the co-location facility and professional services categories. 

The co-location facility costs are projected to exceed budget by approximately $10,000 due to additional power infrastructure requirements identified during detailed design. Professional services are projected to exceed budget by $10,000 due to additional specialized expertise needed for cloud security configuration and application compatibility assessment.

We have used $25,000 of the contingency reserve to date, primarily to address security compliance requirements that emerged during the cloud architecture design phase. The remaining contingency is adequate for anticipated risks, including possible additional resources that may be needed to address the co-location facility schedule delay.

### Scope Commentary
Project scope remains stable with only two approved changes to date. During the infrastructure discovery phase, we identified 10 additional development servers that need to be migrated. Additionally, during the security design review, the Security team requested enhanced cloud security monitoring beyond the original requirements. Both changes were approved and have been incorporated into the project plan.

A third change request for upgrading the network bandwidth between the co-location facility and cloud provider is currently under review. Initial performance testing suggests the originally planned bandwidth may be insufficient for optimal application performance during peak loads.

Technical discovery activities have identified three legacy applications that have compatibility issues with the new environment. We are currently developing specialized migration approaches for these applications, which may include application-level modifications, containerization, or maintaining specific legacy components in the new environment.

### Key Decisions

| Decision ID | Description | Decision Date | Decision Maker | Impact |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| D-015 | Implement enhanced security monitoring for cloud environment (CR-002) | September 30, 2025 | Steering Committee | $25K budget increase, improved security posture |
| D-017 | Use containerization approach for legacy financial reporting application | October 15, 2025 | James Wilson/David Williams | Enables migration without application rewrite |
| D-018 | Proceed with co-location facility setup despite rack installation delays | October 20, 2025 | Michael Chen | Facility will still be operational by revised date |

### RAID Commentary
Application compatibility remains our highest risk as we've identified three specific applications with compatibility issues. Resolution approaches have been identified for two of them (containerization for one, maintaining specific legacy components for another), but the third application (legacy custom ERP module) still requires further assessment. This may impact the migration schedule for these specific applications.

The co-location facility delay is our most pressing current issue. The vendor is working to expedite installation and we've rescheduled some parallel activities, but this will require close monitoring to ensure it doesn't impact the overall schedule.

Network performance between the co-location facility and cloud environment is emerging as a significant concern based on initial testing. We've submitted CR-003 to increase the bandwidth, which is pending review. This is important to address before the migration of data-intensive applications.

### Resource Constraints and Actions

We are currently experiencing two resource constraints:

1. **Network Engineer with SD-WAN Experience**: This specialized skill is required for configuring the optimal connectivity between the co-location facility and cloud environments. The network team has reconfigured their assignments to ensure all critical network setup activities continue with available resources while recruitment is finalized. Final interviews are scheduled for next week, and a contractor has been identified as a backup option if the permanent hire cannot be secured in time.

2. **Application Support for Legacy Systems**: We currently have 0.5 FTE gap in application support for some of the legacy applications being migrated. This is creating some challenges for the detailed assessment of the problematic legacy ERP module. We are working with the Application Support Manager to secure additional time from a subject matter expert who previously worked on this application but is currently assigned to another project. Expected resolution by November 1.

To address resource constraints, we've taken the following actions:

* Cross-training team members on cloud technologies (ongoing, 10 team members completed so far)
* Engaging vendor professional services for specialized tasks (cloud security implementation completed)
* Adjusting migration schedule to align with resource availability (scheduling database migrations when DBAs are fully available)
* Implementing knowledge transfer sessions between experienced team members and newer staff

## 10. Summary and Recommendations

### Summary
The Enterprise Data Center Migration project is progressing well despite some challenges. The project is currently 5 days behind schedule due to vendor delays with the co-location facility setup, but this is not expected to impact the overall project timeline due to available contingency in the schedule. The project is tracking 2% under budget, with some variances across categories that are being actively managed.

Key achievements this period include the completion of cloud environment core services provisioning, successful test migrations of non-critical applications, and completion of disaster recovery design. The project team has also successfully identified and is developing mitigation strategies for three legacy applications with compatibility issues.

The project is on track to meet the major milestone of having the cloud environment fully provisioned by November 15, 2025, and beginning non-critical system migrations by November 16, 2025.

### Recommendations

1. **Approve CR-003 for Network Bandwidth Upgrade**: Initial performance testing indicates that the currently planned bandwidth between co-location and cloud environments may be insufficient. We recommend approving the change request to increase this bandwidth to ensure optimal application performance and avoid potential performance issues after migration.

2. **Accelerate Knowledge Transfer for Hybrid Environment Management**: While training is in progress, we recommend accelerating the knowledge transfer activities for IT operations staff to ensure they are fully prepared to manage the hybrid environment after migration. This includes more shadowing opportunities and hands-on exercises.

3. **Enhance Business Readiness Activities**: To address the risk of business units not being ready for migrations, we recommend increasing the frequency of readiness assessments and communication with business unit leaders to ensure all prerequisites are in place before scheduled migrations.

4. **Authorize Contingency Resources for Co-location Facility**: To mitigate the schedule risk related to the co-location facility delays, we recommend authorizing the use of additional resources to expedite setup activities once the equipment arrives, which may require drawing from the contingency budget.
