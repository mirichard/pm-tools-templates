## Definition of Done

A user story is considered DONE when:

1. All tasks associated with the story are complete
2. Code has been reviewed and approved by at least one peer
3. All unit tests are passing with >90% coverage
4. Integration tests are passing
5. UI components are responsive on all target devices
6. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
7. Product Owner has accepted the implementation
8. Code is deployed to the development environment

## Sprint Planning Notes

1. **Risk Factors**:
   - SSO integration complexity may exceed estimates
   - Team has limited experience with GDPR compliance requirements
   - DevOps engineer has limited availability

2. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Technical spike on SSO completed pre-sprint
   - Compliance expert available for consultation
   - Critical DevOps tasks scheduled early in sprint
   - Daily check-ins on progress of high-risk items

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Cloud infrastructure needs to be provisioned before deployment (Rafael, Day 1-2)
   - UI design approval needed before frontend implementation (Priya, Day 1-3)
   - SSO provider needs to approve our application (Maria, Day 1, external dependency)

## Team Commitments

The team commits to:

1. Delivering all must-have user stories and requirements
2. Holding daily stand-ups at 9:30 AM
3. Maintaining the task board with up-to-date status
4. Communicating blockers immediately to the Scrum Master
5. Supporting each other to ensure sprint success

## Acceptance Criteria Refinement

During sprint planning, the team refined some acceptance criteria for clarity:

### US-101 Additional Details:
- Password requirements: min 12 characters, require uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- User accounts must have mandatory fields: First name, Last name, Email, Department
- Deactivated users should be hidden by default in the user list but accessible through a filter

### US-103 Additional Details:
- Maximum session duration: 8 hours regardless of activity
- Remember user preference must be explicitly opted-in and comply with privacy regulations
- Failed login attempts should be limited to 5 before temporary account lock
