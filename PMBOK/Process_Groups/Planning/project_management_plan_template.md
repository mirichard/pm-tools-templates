## 2. Project Scope Management

### 2.1 Scope Management Approach
*Describe how project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.*

*Example: Project scope will be defined through requirements gathering workshops with key stakeholders and documented in a Requirements Traceability Matrix.

  - Integration with 3 remaining systems (CRM, Email, Document Management)
  - User training for all affected staff
  - Documentation and knowledge transfer
  
* Out of Scope:
  - Hardware infrastructure upgrades
  - Changes to the customer-facing portal
  - Customization of standard reports beyond the agreed list
  - Historical data older than 5 years*

Dependencies were identified through planning sessions with key stakeholders.*

### 3.3 Schedule Control
*Define the process for monitoring schedule performance and managing changes to the schedule.*

*Example: Schedule performance will be measured using Earned Value Management metrics (SPI, SV). The critical path will be analyzed weekly to identify potential delays. Schedule changes will be evaluated through the change control process and may require re-baselining with appropriate approvals.*

The schedule baseline will be maintained in the project repository and used as the reference point for schedule performance measurement and variance analysis.*

### 12.3 Cost Baseline
*Describe the approved cost baseline against which project cost performance will be measured and changes will be evaluated.*

*Example: The cost baseline is documented in the Project Budget (Version 1.0, approved on February 28, 2026). It includes:
1. Cost estimates by work package
2. Cost breakdown by project phase
3. Resource costs by time period
4. Contingency reserves allocation

The cost baseline totals $1,125,000, which excludes the management reserve of $75,000. The total project budget, including management reserve, is $1,200,000. The cost baseline will be maintained in the project repository and used as the reference point for cost performance measurement and variance analysis.*

### 12.4 Performance Measurement Baseline
*Describe how the integrated scope, schedule, and cost baselines will be used to measure project performance.*

*Example: The Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) integrates the scope, schedule, and cost baselines to provide a coordinated reference for measuring project performance. Earned Value Management metrics (SPI, CPI, SV, CV, EAC, ETC, VAC) will be calculated and reported monthly based on the PMB. Performance thresholds have been established as follows:
1. SPI or CPI < 0.9 or > 1.2: Requires corrective action plan
2. Variance at Completion (VAC) > 10%: Requires re-baselining consideration
3. Cumulative SV or CV > $50,000: Requires executive notification

The PMB will only be modified through the formal change control process.*

### 13.2 Plan Maintenance
*Describe how this Project Management Plan will be maintained and updated throughout the project lifecycle.*

*Example: This Project Management Plan is a living document that will be reviewed and updated as follows:
1. Regular review at the end of each project phase
2. After significant approved changes to project scope, schedule, or budget
3. When significant issues or risks require changes to project approach
4. At least quarterly throughout the project lifecycle

Updates to this plan will follow the change control process. The Project Manager is responsible for maintaining this document and distributing updates to all stakeholders. All versions will be stored in the project repository with clear version control.*
