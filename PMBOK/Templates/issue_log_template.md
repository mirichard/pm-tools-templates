## 1. Issue Management Approach

### 1.1 Issue Management Process Overview
*Briefly describe the issue management approach for the project, including how issues will be identified, logged, analyzed, resolved, and closed.*

*Example: This project follows a structured issue management process to ensure all problems are identified, documented, and resolved in a timely manner. Issues may be identified by any project stakeholder and should be reported to the project manager or designated issue coordinator. All issues will be logged, assessed for priority and impact, assigned to an owner for resolution, tracked until closure, and reviewed for lessons learned. Status updates on active issues will be provided in weekly status meetings, with high-priority issues escalated according to the defined procedures.*

|----------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Immediate action required; project is blocked or significant objectives threatened | Same day response; continuous work until resolved or mitigated | Production system down preventing all work |
| **High** | Urgent issue requiring prompt attention; significant impact on project component | Response within 24 hours; resolution efforts prioritized | Critical path activity blocked, major deliverable at risk |
| **Medium** | Important issue requiring scheduled resolution; moderate impact on project component | Response within 2-3 days; resolution according to planned schedule | Non-critical path activity impacted, manageable workaround exists |
| **Low** | Issue requires resolution but is not time-sensitive; minimal impact on project | Response within 1 week; resolution as resources permit | Minor inconvenience, cosmetic issues, documentation error |

### 3.2 Severity Levels

*Define the severity levels for issues based on impact to the project.*

*Example:*

| Severity Level | Description | Impact |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Showstopper** | Catastrophic impact; prevents essential functions from being performed | Prevents project continuation, critical business functions cannot be executed |
| **Major** | Significant impact; severely restricts functionality | Major project components or deliverables affected, limited workaround available |
| **Moderate** | Noticeable impact; some functions affected but overall functionality maintained | Specific project activities affected, workarounds available but not optimal |
| **Minor** | Minimal impact; minor inconvenience but no functional restriction | Limited effect on project activities, easy workaround available |

### 3.3 Priority-Severity Matrix

*Provide a visual representation of the relationship between priority and severity.*

*Example:*

* *Critical-2: Immediate resolution team, daily executive updates*
* *High-1: Dedicated resources, reported to steering committee*
* *High-2: Scheduled resolution team, reported in status reports*
* *Medium-1: Planned resolution, weekly tracking*
