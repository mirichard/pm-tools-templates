## 2. Change Description and Justification

### 2.1 Change Description
*Provide a clear, concise description of the proposed change. Be specific about what is changing from the current baseline.*

*Example: Add a mobile-responsive user interface to the customer portal module. The current approved scope includes only desktop browser compatibility, but this change would add full functionality for mobile devices (iOS and Android).*

### 2.2 Change Justification
*Explain why this change is needed. Reference business requirements, issues, or opportunities that this change addresses.*

*Example: Customer analytics show that 45% of users attempt to access the portal via mobile devices, but the current design doesn't support mobile browsers. This change would improve customer satisfaction and increase portal usage, directly supporting our strategic goal of improving digital customer engagement.*

### 2.3 Business Case
*Provide a business case for the change, including benefits, costs, and return on investment.*

**Benefits:**  
*Example:*
* *Increase customer engagement by estimated 30%*
* *Reduce customer support calls related to mobile access by estimated 25%*
* *Generate additional revenue of approximately $100,000 per year through increased mobile transactions*
* *Improve customer satisfaction ratings by estimated 15%*

**Costs:**  
*Example:*
* *Additional development effort: 120 person-hours at $75/hour = $9,000*
* *Additional testing effort: 40 person-hours at $60/hour = $2,400*
* *Additional documentation updates: 20 person-hours at $50/hour = $1,000*
* *Total estimated cost: $12,400*

**Return on Investment:**  
*Example: Estimated ROI of 706% in first year ($100,000 benefit vs. $12,400 cost), with ongoing benefits in subsequent years.*

### 2.4 Consequences of Not Implementing
*Describe what will happen if this change is not implemented.*

*Example: Without mobile compatibility, we will continue to see low engagement from mobile users, resulting in continued customer dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities. Competitors who offer mobile access will have a competitive advantage, potentially leading to customer attrition.*
