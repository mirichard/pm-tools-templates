### Executive Summary Narrative
*Provide a concise (3-5 sentences) summary of the current status, highlighting significant achievements, challenges, and any immediate attention items. This should be written for executives who have limited time and need to quickly understand the current state.*

*Example: The ERP implementation is currently on schedule and within budget. The Finance module configuration has been completed ahead of schedule, while the HR module is facing minor delays due to resource constraints. The project team successfully mitigated the data migration risk by implementing automated validation tools. Executive decision is needed on the scope change request for additional reporting capabilities, which may impact the budget by 5%.*

## 2. Schedule Status

### Key Milestones

| Milestone | Planned Date | Forecast Date | Status | Variance (days) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| *Requirements Sign-off* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *Complete/In Progress/At Risk/Delayed* | *+/- X days* |
| *Design Approval* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *Complete/In Progress/At Risk/Delayed* | *+/- X days* |
| *Development Complete* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *Complete/In Progress/At Risk/Delayed* | *+/- X days* |
| *Testing Complete* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *Complete/In Progress/At Risk/Delayed* | *+/- X days* |
| *Go-Live* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *Complete/In Progress/At Risk/Delayed* | *+/- X days* |

### Schedule Metrics
* **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** *[0.95]* *(< 1.0 indicates behind schedule)*
* **Schedule Variance (SV):** *[-10 days]*
* **Critical Path Slack:** *[5 days]*
* **Current Phase:** *[Design/Development/Testing]*
* **Phase Completion:** *[65%]*

### Schedule Commentary
*Provide analysis of schedule performance, explain any variances, describe corrective actions for delays, and forecast any potential future schedule impacts.*

*Example: The project is currently 10 days behind schedule due to delayed vendor deliverables in the integration module. We have implemented a mitigation plan including additional resources for parallel testing activities and weekend work for the configuration team. These measures are expected to recover 7 days, leaving a net delay of 3 days, which can be accommodated within the existing schedule contingency. The critical path now runs through the integration testing activities, which will be closely monitored.*

## 3. Budget Status

### Financial Summary

| Budget Category | Approved Budget | Committed Cost | Actual Cost to Date | Estimate at Completion | Variance | Variance % |
|-----------------|----------------:|---------------:|--------------------:|-----------------------:|---------:|----------:|
| *Labor* | *$500,000* | *$300,000* | *$250,000* | *$520,000* | *-$20,000* | *-4%* |
| *Hardware* | *$150,000* | *$140,000* | *$140,000* | *$140,000* | *$10,000* | *7%* |
| *Software* | *$250,000* | *$250,000* | *$250,000* | *$250,000* | *$0* | *0%* |
| *Travel* | *$50,000* | *$30,000* | *$25,000* | *$40,000* | *$10,000* | *20%* |
| *Training* | *$75,000* | *$40,000* | *$30,000* | *$75,000* | *$0* | *0%* |
| *Contingency* | *$100,000* | *$0* | *$0* | *$50,000* | *$50,000* | *50%* |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,125,000** | **$760,000** | **$695,000** | **$1,075,000** | **$50,000** | **4%** |

### Budget Metrics
* **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** *[1.03]* *(> 1.0 indicates under budget)*
* **Cost Variance (CV):** *[$21,000]*
* **Percent Budget Spent:** *[62%]*
* **Contingency Remaining:** *[$50,000]* *(50% of original)*

### Budget Commentary
*Provide analysis of budget performance, explain variances, describe any cost containment measures, and indicate future spending projections.*

*Example: Overall, the project is tracking 4% under budget, primarily due to savings in hardware procurement ($10,000) and lower than anticipated travel costs. Labor costs are projected to exceed budget by $20,000 due to the additional resources needed to address schedule delays. We anticipate using $50,000 of the contingency fund to cover these overages, leaving the overall project within the approved total budget.*

## 4. Scope Status

### Scope Changes

| Change ID | Description | Status | Impact on Schedule | Impact on Budget | Decision Date |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| *CR-001* | *Add reporting dashboard* | *Approved* | *+5 days* | *+$15,000* | *YYYY-MM-DD* |
| *CR-002* | *Custom data integration with CRM* | *Under Review* | *+10 days* | *+$30,000* | *Pending* |
| *CR-003* | *Reduce training scope* | *Rejected* | *-3 days* | *-$5,000* | *YYYY-MM-DD* |

### Requirements Status
* **Total Requirements:** *[120]*
* **Requirements Defined:** *[105]* *(88%)*
* **Requirements Approved:** *[95]* *(79%)*
* **Requirements Completed:** *[60]* *(50%)*
* **Requirements with Issues:** *[8]* *(7%)*

### Deliverables Status

| Deliverable | Planned Completion | Status | % Complete | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|------------|-------|
| *System Architecture Document* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *Complete* | *100%* | *Approved by Architecture Review Board* |
| *Data Migration Strategy* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *In Progress* | *75%* | *Data mapping in progress* |
| *User Training Materials* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *Not Started* | *0%* | *Dependent on UI finalization* |

### Scope Commentary
*Provide analysis of the current scope status, including adherence to the original scope, impact of approved changes, and potential future scope changes being considered.*

*Example: The project scope remains mostly stable with one approved change request (CR-001) adding a reporting dashboard, which has been incorporated into the schedule and budget. A second change request for custom CRM integration is under review and would represent a significant addition to the project scope. To accommodate this addition, if approved, we would need to adjust the go-live date and secure additional budget. The requirements definition phase is nearly complete (88%), allowing the development team to proceed with most of the work while the remaining requirements are finalized.*

| *D-005* | *Use cloud-based training environment* | *YYYY-MM-DD* | *Project Manager* | *Reduces setup time, increases cost by $5K* |

### RAID Commentary
*Provide analysis of the most significant risks, issues, actions, and decisions and their potential impact on project success.*

*Example: The most critical risk facing the project continues to be data quality issues that could impact the migration process. The mitigation strategy includes implementing data validation tools and conducting cleansing activities, which has reduced the risk probability from High to Medium. Two high-priority issues emerged this reporting period related to financial reporting requirements and performance testing environments. Resolution plans are in place for both issues with target completion dates in the next two weeks. The steering committee's decision to proceed with phase 1 without custom reports has clarified the scope and improved the confidence in meeting the scheduled go-live date.*
