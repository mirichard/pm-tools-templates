## 1. Risk Management Approach

### 1.1 Risk Management Process Overview
*Briefly describe the risk management approach for the project, including how risks will be identified, analyzed, responded to, and monitored.*

*Example: This project follows a proactive risk management approach aligned with PMI best practices. Risks will be identified through team brainstorming sessions, stakeholder interviews, expert judgment, and lessons learned from similar projects. Risks will be analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, with appropriate response strategies developed for each. Key risks will be monitored at weekly status meetings, with the full Risk Register reviewed monthly by the Project Steering Committee.*

### 1.2 Roles and Responsibilities

*Define who is responsible for various risk management activities.*

*Example:*

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Project Manager | Overall accountability for risk management, facilitates risk identification activities, ensures response plans are implemented, reports on risk status |
| Project Team | Identify risks, provide expertise for analysis, implement risk responses when assigned |
| Risk Owner | Accountable for monitoring and controlling specific assigned risks, implementing response strategies |
| Steering Committee | Review high-level risks, make decisions on risk response strategies requiring additional resources |
| Stakeholders | Identify risks within their areas of expertise, support risk response implementation |

### 1.3 Risk Thresholds

*Define the risk thresholds that determine which risks require response planning and which are accepted without further action.*

*Example:*

| Risk Score | Threshold Category | Action Required |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 15-25 | High | Immediate attention required. Response strategy must be developed and implemented. Regular monitoring and reporting. Escalate to steering committee. |
| 8-14 | Medium | Response strategy should be developed. Assigned to risk owner for monitoring. Reported in status meetings. |
| 1-7 | Low | Accept or monitor. Document assumptions. No immediate response action required beyond normal monitoring. |

## 3. Risk Assessment

### 3.1 Probability Assessment

*Define the probability scale for evaluating risk likelihood.*

*Example:*

| Score | Level | Description | Probability Range |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| 5 | Very High | Almost certain to occur | >90% |
| 4 | High | Likely to occur | 70-90% |
| 3 | Medium | May occur | 30-70% |
| 2 | Low | Unlikely to occur | 10-30% |
| 1 | Very Low | Rare occurrence | <10% |

### 3.2 Impact Assessment

*Define the impact scale for evaluating risk consequences.*

*Example:*

| Score | Level | Schedule Impact | Cost Impact | Scope/Quality Impact | Reputational Impact |
|-------|-------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 5 | Very High | >2 months | >20% budget increase | Unacceptable to sponsor/stakeholders | Major negative publicity |
| 4 | High | 1-2 months | 10-20% budget increase | Major functionality affected | Limited negative publicity |
| 3 | Medium | 2-4 weeks | 5-10% budget increase | Some functionality affected | Stakeholder complaints |
| 2 | Low | 1-2 weeks | 1-5% budget increase | Minor functionality affected | Minor stakeholder concerns |
| 1 | Very Low | <1 week | <1% budget increase | Minimal effect | No stakeholder concerns |

### 3.3 Risk Score Calculation

*Explain how risk scores are calculated and prioritized.*

*Example: Risk score is calculated by multiplying probability score by impact score:*
* *Risk Score = Probability Score Ã— Impact Score*
* *Range: 1-25*

*For risks with different impacts across categories (schedule, cost, etc.), use the highest impact score for calculation.*

### 3.4 Risk Prioritization Matrix

*Provide a visual representation of risk prioritization.*

*Example:*

| Probability/Impact | Very Low (1) | Low (2) | Medium (3) | High (4) | Very High (5) |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Very High (5)** | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | **25** |
| **High (4)** | 4 | 8 | 12 | **16** | **20** |
| **Medium (3)** | 3 | 6 | **9** | **12** | **15** |
| **Low (2)** | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |
| **Very Low (1)** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

*Legend:*
* *Red (15-25): High Risk - Immediate attention and response required*
* *Yellow (8-14): Medium Risk - Active monitoring and response planning needed*
* *Green (1-7): Low Risk - Monitor or accept with minimal action*

## 4. Risk Response Planning

### 4.1 Response Strategy Types

*Define the different types of risk response strategies.*

*Example:*

| Strategy | Description | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Avoid** | Eliminate the threat by eliminating the cause | High impact threats with feasible elimination options | Change project approach to eliminate dependency on external system |
| **Transfer** | Shift the impact and ownership to a third party | Insurable risks or those better managed by specialists | Obtain insurance, use external vendor with contract penalties |
| **Mitigate** | Reduce probability and/or impact to acceptable levels | Risks that can be reduced through proactive actions | Conduct additional testing, add contingency time |
| **Accept** | Acknowledge risk and take no action unless it occurs | Low risks or those with unfeasible responses | Document low risks and continue monitoring |
| **Contingent Response** | Prepared responses to be used only if certain events occur | Risks that need trigger points for response | Prepare backup vendor if primary vendor performance declines below threshold |
| **Escalate** | Risk outside project scope, escalate to appropriate level | Risks beyond project manager's authority | Organizational policy changes that affect multiple projects |

### 4.2 Risk Response Development

*Provide guidance on developing effective risk responses.*

*Example: Effective risk responses should be:*

* *Appropriate for the significance of the risk*
* *Cost-effective (response cost should not exceed risk impact)*
* *Realistic within project constraints*
* *Agreed upon by relevant stakeholders*
* *Owned by a responsible individual*
* *Timely (implemented before risk trigger occurs)*

### 4.3 Secondary Risks

*Define how to handle secondary risks that may arise from implementing risk responses.*

*Example: All risk responses should be assessed for potential secondary risks. These secondary risks should be identified, analyzed, and added to the Risk Register with their own risk IDs and response plans.*

## 5. Risk Monitoring and Control

### 5.1 Risk Review Schedule

*Define how often risks will be reviewed and by whom.*

*Example:*

| Review Type | Frequency | Participants | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Project Status Meeting | Weekly | Project Team | Review status of active risks, identify new risks |
| Risk Review Meeting | Monthly | Project Team, Key Stakeholders | Comprehensive review of Risk Register |
| Steering Committee Meeting | Monthly | Steering Committee | Review high-priority risks, approve response plans requiring additional resources |
| Risk Reassessment | After major changes | Project Team | Identify new risks and reassess existing risks after significant project changes |

### 5.2 Risk Triggers and Early Warning Signs

*Explain how to identify and use risk triggers for early risk detection.*

*Example: Risk triggers are events or circumstances that indicate a risk is about to occur or has occurred. Each risk should have identified triggers where possible. Project team members should be aware of these triggers and report them immediately when observed. Examples include:*

* *Schedule variance >5% (trigger for schedule delay risk)*
* *Team member resignation (trigger for resource availability risk)*
* *Stakeholder expressing concerns (trigger for scope change risk)*
* *Vendor missing first deliverable (trigger for vendor performance risk)*

### 5.3 Risk Status Tracking

*Define how risk status will be tracked and reported.*

*Example: Risk status will be tracked using the following designations:*

* *Identified: Risk has been identified but not yet analyzed*
* *Analyzed: Risk has been assessed for probability and impact*
* *Planned: Response strategy has been determined*
* *In Progress: Response actions are being implemented*
* *Monitoring: Risk is being actively monitored*
* *Occurred: Risk has materialized and become an issue*
* *Closed: Risk is no longer relevant to the project*
* *Residual: Risk has been addressed but residual risk remains*
